# TextEngine
C# Text Adventure Engine

The plan is to create an Engine for creating text adventures. 

The basic classes are mostly in place.
Next I need to decide how to interpret commands, as I do not like how it was done in the C++ version I wrote.
After that I need to decide what scripting languge to use for implementing the items and rooms and such. Last time it was Lua. Might just try using C# we will see.

If you would like to contribute or provide critisim please do so!
